### TODO
- [ ] Getting started section of readme
- [ ] Units can currently attack the enemy from anywhere on the grid. Need to change so they can only attack if adjacent to the enemy
- [ ] Fix unit swapping
- [ ] Adjust reward for combos
- [ ] Add character abilities, passives, stats, etc.
- [ ] Beautify PyGame environment
- [ ] More accurate action space (ex: ability to move multiple units at once)
